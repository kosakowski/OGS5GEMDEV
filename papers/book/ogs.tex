\section{From RockFlow to OpenGeoSys - a historical note ...}

Looking back to a more than 20 years lasting scientific project as ''RockFlow'' is amazing ... and at the same time completely impossible to be comprehensive and to be fair concerning all the individual contributions of more than 20 PhD projects so far ...
The intelectual origins of OGS are clearly based on the work of Hans-Jörg Diersch, Mr. FEFLOW \cite{Die:1985}, a great success story in scientific software for groundwater modeling. I had the luck to be a PhD student of Professor Diersch who was intriguing me to become a software scentist \cite{Kol:1990,Kolditz1993467}.

\subsubsection*{RockFlow-1}

Somewhen in the mid eighties Dr. Liedtke with the Federal Institute of Geosciences (BGR) was asking Prof. Zielke (Institute of Hydromechanics, University of Hannover) whether the development of a simulation programm for fractured rock is possible. (Never ask a scientist about impossible things). The idea was born (including some funding from the BGR): the development of a computer code based on multi-dimensional FEM. The first name was DURST, which for Germans is not really a good choice (because it means "thirsty"). Later it was renamed into Rockflow: Flow and associated processes in rock. The pioneering work of RockFlow-1 was done in the following four doctoral dissertations \cite{Kro:1990}, \cite{Wol:1991}, \cite{Hel:1993}, \cite{Sha:1994}.

\subsubsection*{RockFlow-2}

The next stages in the early nineties was related to couple the individual RF-1 modules and improve the computational efficiency, e.g. by introducing iterative equation solver. RockFlow-2 was now used in several application projects as waste deposition and geothermal energy (\cite{Leg:1995},\cite{Kol:1996}). A "market" for RockFlow in Applied Geoscience was open.
From this time the most cited RockFlow paper so far \cite{KolRatDieZie:98} originated (more than 70 times, which is not so bad for a modeling paper).

\subsubsection*{RockFlow-3}

It turned out that the coupling of the different RF modules needed a new code structure.
Moreover for the use of grid-adaptive methods dynamic data structures have been necessary.
Consequently, in the late nineties a complete re-organization of RF was started. C experience began ...
\cite{MSR:1996}, \cite{Bar:1997}.
Major research topics of the RF group had been multi-phase flow \cite{Tho:01}, grid adaptation \cite{Kai:01}, reactive transport \cite{Hab:01}, and deformation processes
\cite{Koh:2006}. Beside the numerical parts geometric modeling and meshing methods became more and more important \cite{Rot:01}, \cite{Moe:2004}.

\subsubsection*{GeoSys/RockFlow-4}

Tuebingen:
Due to the increasing functionality, the RF code became more and more sophisticated and difficult to handle.
Consequently, the introduction of object-oriented methods was necessary. RF-4 or now GeoSys was (again) completely re-designed and rewritten in C++
\cite{oK04}, \cite{wW06}.
Several doctoral theses have been prepared in the fields of geotechnical simulation (DECOVALEX project, \cite{Eng:03}, \cite{deJ:2004}, \cite{Wal:2007}), contaminant hydrology (Virtual Aquifer project, \cite{Bei:2005}, \cite{Bey:2007}, \cite{Mil:2007}), geothermal reservoir modeling (Urach Spa project, \cite{Ten:2006}).
Aside computational mechanics progress had been made as well in the pre-processing for numerical analysis \cite{Kal:2006}, \cite{Gro:2006}, \cite{Che:2006}.
First GeoSys/RockFlow habilitations appeared \cite{Bau:2006}, \cite{McD:2006}, \cite{Kos:2007}.
As mentioned in the beginning it is impossible to cite everything, other important works in the Tuebingen era are \cite{ParEtAl:2007}, \cite{KolEtAl:2007}, \cite{XieEtAl:2006}.

\subsubsection*{OpenGeoSys}

Leipzig:
The new challenge for GeoSys is to continue the development as a distributed open-source project, i.e. sharing and widening the knowledge, as people from the GeoSys group got interesting offers. The number of  GeoSys-project partners is already quite large (see cover page).
At the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research a new research platform TESSIN is available, which combines high-performance-computing (HPC) and visualization facilities. Post-processing becomes more and more important as more and more information becomes available, due to high-resolution measurement techniques and HPC itself \cite{WanEtAl:2008}.
